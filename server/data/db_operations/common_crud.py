--------------

This module provides generic, reusable CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) 
operations for all SQLAlchemy ORM models in the system. It centralizes 
common database interactions to ensure consistency across the codebase.

Functions included here cover:
- Creating single or multiple model instances (`create`, `create_model`, `create_all`)
- Reading single or multiple records (`read`, `read_all`, `find`)
- Updating model fields (`update`)
- Deleting records in several ways (`delete`, `delete_by`, `delete_all`)
